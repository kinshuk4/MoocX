# German Future Tense and How to use it



## German Future Tense

The German future tense is very similar to the future tense in English. To talk about something in the future, you can use the present tense as you do in English.

**For example:**
We’re flying to France next year. ⇨ Wir fliegen nächstes Jahr nach Frankreich.
Ich spiele morgen Gittare. ⇨ I’m playing the guitar tomorrow.

However there is a dedicated German future tense used to talk about something that will happen in the future. Quite often it is used to emphasise something that will definitely happen in the future.

**Some example sentences:**
He will drive to Spain. ⇨ Er wird nach Spanien fahren.
You will go shopping tomorrow. ⇨ Du wirst morgen einkaufen gehen.

 

### How is the German future tense formed?

The German future tense is formed using the normal present tense of the verb **werden**. When used on its own in a future tense sentence, it means **to become**, however in English we will often say **will become / will get / will be** instead.
**Table: The verb werden**

| **Pronoun**   | **werden** | **Meaning**           |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| ich           | werde      | I become              |
| du            | wirst      | you become            |
| er / sie / es | wird       | he / she / it becomes |
| wir           | werden     | we become             |
| ihr           | werdet     | you become            |
| sie / Sie     | werden     | they / you become     |

**Example sentences:**

I will be 25 on Saturday. ⇨ Ich **werde** am Samstag 25 Jahre alt. (Literal: I become on Saturday 25 years old.)

He will soon be a father. ⇨ Er **wird** bald Vater. (Literal: He becomes soon father.)

You will get better every day. ⇨ Ihr **werdet** jeden Tag besser. (Literal: You become every day better.)

 

### German Future Tense with additional Verb

When you want to talk about doing something in the future, you will need to construct the sentence in two parts.

- The first part is as above with the present tense form of the verb **werden**.

- ​

- The second part is the **verb** which explains what you will be doing. This verb goes to the end of the sentence.

**Example sentences:**

They will buy a car. ⇨ Sie **werden** ein Auto **kaufen**. (Literal: They will a car buy.)

You will win tomorrow. ⇨ Du **wirst** morgen **gewinnen**. (Literal: You will tomorrow win.)

I will kiss you. ⇨ Ich **werde** dich **küssen**. (Literal: I will you kiss.)

**Note:** With reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun (mich, dich, sich etc) comes straight after the present tense form of **werden**.
