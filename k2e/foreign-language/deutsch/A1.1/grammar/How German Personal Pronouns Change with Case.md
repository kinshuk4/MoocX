# How German Personal Pronouns Change with Case

### German Pronouns

German personal pronouns are a little more complicated than in English (no surprise there!). It can be tricky to get to grips with but learning the different forms is a vital step in learning the German language. The form that the personal pronoun takes is dependent on the [case](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/795/how-the-german-cases-work-nominative-accusative-dative-and-genetive) of the sentence. The table below will show you which form fits with which [case](http://www.jabbalab.com/blog/795/how-the-german-cases-work-nominative-accusative-dative-and-genetive).

### Personal Pronouns and the Cases

| Pronoun           | Nominative    | Accusative     | Dative          | Genitive          |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| **ich**           | ich           | mich           | mir             | mein              |
| **du**            | du            | dich           | dir             | dein              |
| **er / sie / es** | er / sie / es | ihn / sie / es | ihm / ihr / ihm | sein / ihr / sein |
| **wir**           | wir           | uns            | uns             | unser             |
| **ihr**           | ihr           | euch           | euch            | euer              |
| **sie / Sie**     | sie / Sie     | sie / Sie      | ihnen / Ihnen   | ihr / Ihr         |

The genitive case is almost never used in a personal pronoun situation as the genitive case by its nature relates to possesion (whose…). Therefore the above table has the genitive possesive adjectives instead of the personal pronouns.
