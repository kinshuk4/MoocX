###LINQ Reference
Just a simple reference solution I wrote up for coworkers demonstrating how to use various Linq operators. Been a helpful way to remind myself how to use some of the operators I don't touch that often, like GroupJoin and Zip. Adapted from TekPub's extra awesome Mastering Linq screencasts.
