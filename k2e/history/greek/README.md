# Ancient Greek History

Fabio and Gabrielle Arciniegas notes from course covering history of Ancient greece from Bronze Age to Death of Socrates (1700 B.C to 399 B.C) available at [https://www.coursera.org/learn/ancient-greeks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ancient-greeks)

# Prehistory to Homer

General facts:

- Diet made of olives, grapes and grain (wheat,barley, some corn)
- Olives were given by Athena to the Athenians upon foundation of the city, whence the dedication of the city to her.

The 3.4 million years of homo sapiens stone age up to 3000 BC is not covered. The 1300 years of bronze age before the Minoan civilization are not considered either.

Mnemonic note: ancient greek history seems to "move north" starting with minos and myceneae, followed by sparta and athens, finally thullyde and macedonia.

## Minoan Civilization (1700 BC - 1400 BC)

Minoan is a name given to this civilization by Sir Arthur Evans, a wealthy man who in 1900 bought substantial amounts of land in Crete and finance many excavation and restoration projects (it was Evans who planted the trees that now adorn the site in knossos)

Famous delphi fresco of bull jumping and Bull Rhyton (drinking cup) come from this period in Crete. Important aesthetically and also because a lot of the events are pieced tobether by material culture.

Thucydides writes that Minos had the first naval fleet.

Other facts:

- Pithoid is a large jar for storing oil, like Ali Baba's.
- Knossos was the capital of Minos
- The written language is called by scholars "linear a/b"

## Myceneaen Civilization (1200 BC - 1150 BC)

Similar to Crete, Myceneas had a rich 20th century "patron," Heinrich Schilemann. A great deal of important artifacts were found under his interest in the island.

Important artifacts include: Tholostomb Treasury of Atreus Mask of Agammennon ([http://bit.ly/1PiDwES](http://bit.ly/1PiDwES))

# Dark Ages (1150 BC - 800 BC)

Collapse of earliest greek civilization. Causes unknown but possibly: climate, invasion of hordes from the north (however this later not particularly believed nowadays)

# Archaic Age (776 - 500 BC)

A time before the great antiquity but extremely important and formative for greek identiy. Starts with 776, the first olympiad.

Some key aspects of the archaic age:

Homer (~850 BC - ~780 BC) ([https://goo.gl/r88GQy](https://goo.gl/r88GQy)) Begining ofthe Polis (city), Politeia (citizenship) and Polites (citizen) Agora, Center of social life Theseus, after killing the minotaur goes back to Athens, is crowned king and makes a common shrine to Athena. Sets up games

## Polis

By the time Aristotle writes of the Polis (end of the timeline in this course) , the idea was already in decline but his words go to show how integral to greek identity the polis was: Man as a political animal, means he belongs to a Polis. If out of it he must be either an animal or a god.

~750 BC sees the birth of the polis. With it, the notion of Metropolis (mother city), Apoikia (colony) and Oikistes (founder)

Other points: Just as Athena has her shrine, her brother Apollo has his at mount Parnassus, which he appropriated from his enemy, the dragon-serpent Python. That is why the name of the people in Apollo’s temple is the Pythia. Mount Parnassus is in Delphi. The oracle of Delphi key to divination and purification

## Literacy in Archaic age

Nomos: law, custom Eunomia: lawfulness, good laws well obeyed

In the myth/tradition of the lawgiver, the lawgiver gives people a code, usually one after travelling abroad. A challenge usually occurs which entails the dead of the lawgiver (sometimes the breaking of the law by the lawgiver himself). Lawgiver dies but law persists. Law over lawgiver.

Other key features of the archaic period:

The Gortyn code (500 BC) The first appeareance of the Hoplite (free fighter characterized by his Panople or set of helment breast plate, shield and spear) The creation of the Phalanx, 8 hoplites in tight formation as land-fighting unit

### Lyric Poem

As opposed to the epic poem we now see many meters other than the hexameter B , and a prominence of “I,” the personal reflection and human scale of the topic. Archilochus mentions for example: “to hell with my lost shield, some jubilant thracian my have it.”

It is Archilochus who says “The fox knows many things, the hedgehog only an important one.” (practicality vs erudition).

Alceus, and the famous Sapho from Lesbos also belong to the archaic lyric poem tradition, around 7C BCE. A small famous sample that underlines the personal nature of this work: the thing most beautiful to each person loves is that which they love (in her case, Anaktoria):

```
        Some say an army of horsemen,
        some of footsoldiers, some of ships,
        is the fairest thing on the black earth,
        but I say it is what one loves.

```

### Hesiod

Epic poetry, however, is not over. The other great epic poet, Hesiod, shares the tradition of Homer but the focus is very different, the genealogy of the gods, the Theogony.

Hesiods theogony describes some of the most famous passages for the first time. This includes the marriage of Epimethous to Pandora and her unleashing of all maladies *including* hope (Hope is human: animals don’t have it, gods don’t need it). Chaos to Cosmos. Some highlights: In hesiod Gaia produces Uranus spontaneously (in other sources Aether is his father) Gaia (earth) and Uranus (sky) marry have Chronos Chronos castrates uranus Chronus devours his children ([http://bit.ly/1PBDbsR](http://bit.ly/1PBDbsR)). Zeus dethrones him but it’s less specified how he did it. Prometheus tricks Zeus, whence no more fire. When gods quarrel men suffer

# Sparta and Athens

The Peloponnese or Peloponnesus is a peninsula and geographic region in southern Greece. It is separated from the central part of the country by the Gulf of Corinth.

Located on the Peloponesse, Sparta is the home of Meneleaus and Helen (of Troy fame). What is left is not much but as Thucydides points out “Athenian ruins would be misleading,” and so would Spartan.

Sparta comes to prominence and identity through the Messenian wars (messenia being a different part of the pelopennesus peninsula). The first messenian war (740-720) is won then there is the foundation of an Apoikia named Taros (710) and then the defeat of sparta in 670. The second messenian war from 670 to 650 solidifes Spartan supremacy in the region and establish a class named Helots.

The Helots are the conquered many from messenia. They outnumber the spartans and are their slaves.

In Homer the stucture shown for government is King, council, and assembly. In Sparta this is generally the case with a system of one or two kings (the diarchy), the Gerousia (60 year old+ members) acting as council, the Demos getting together as the Appella (as decreed by law giver Lycurgus) and the Ephors, five men in charge of maintaining the order.

The Perioeci were people in the periphery, hard to classify outsiders. The spartans, particularly those of 30 years of age or more who could be part of the Apella were the Homoioi, the “alike ones,” the peers. They received an allotment of land and Helots.

Perhaps the most memorable part of Spartan identity is their upbringing methods, the Agoge. It included strict training and also the bonding over killing of helots. this would be called the Krypteia.

It was a hoplite republic, proud of its strength as shown by devotion to Orthia (later assimilated as Artemis and whence called Artemis Orthia). Orthia has a dead bird in each hand. Young Spartans would be flogged in her altar as sport, instruction, and a way to show toughness.

# Tyrants (655-580)

The Bacchiads were a clan practicing extreme endogamy (marriage between themselves) who ruled in Corinth before the rise of the first Tyrant, Cypselus who dethroned them and ruled from 655-625.

## Cypselus and Periander (655-625, 625-580)

Cypselus was actually the son of Labda, a Bacchiad woman who was ugly and unmarried to anyone in the clan. An outsider named Aetion married her and they had what Delphi had prophecized: a child born of our outside wedlock who would bring destruction to the Bacchiads.

Periander, son of Cypselus was both a tyrant and one of the seven sages:

Thales of Miletus Solon of Athens Pittacus of Mytilene (Lesbos) Bias of Priene Chilon of Sparta (ephor) Cleobulus of Lindus (Rhodes) Periander of Corinth

The political structure during this archaic time in Athens had at the top the Eupatride (those with good fathers) -> Aeropagus (council at the top of the hill of the same name) -> Archons.

Archon Basileus was a famous polemarch (military man of high rank, one of nine council) who give his name to this class.

Notice that Anarchy is the name given to the year without Archons.

## Draco

Draco (from which the name Draconian is derived) established in 622 the first set of laws, famous for their harshness but useful in the removal of the blood for blood impracticalities. In this sense Draco can be remembered as a real life step towards the type of justice Aeschylus’ explains in the Eumenides where simple primitive revenge ends at odds with itself (Orestes trying to avenge father must kill mother, Clytemnestra).

## Solon (638-558)

Wise statesman and reluctant tyrant, expressed his reluctance to tyranny in a symposium, replaced the standard of birth (eupatride) with one of wealth, creating the chance for upwards mobility.

## Peisistratus (561-528)

Built a civic identity. First panathenian currency. So good Aristotle who is not a fan of tyrants at all gives him a pass.

# Democratic Revolution (514)

In 514, over a feud results in the assasination of Hyparkus, tyrant son of Peisistratus. This marks the beginning of Athenian democracy. Kleisthenes is credited as the father of the Athenian democracy and his reforms (including the representatives from regions and the idea of ostracism to keep potential tyrants from rising) become a hallmark of athenian democray.

# Herodotus (484)

Father of history. First historian of the greeks.

From modern-day Bodrum Turkey (ancient Halicarnassus). it is from him we get the account of the persian wars.

From Herodotus we get the story of Croesus, King of Lydida who in 560 consults delphi before going to war with Cyrus in persia. Delphi says “you will destroy a great empire.” Croesus,a vain man misinterprets this and is beaten by Darius.

Another famous part of Croesus story is the “Solon vs Croesus” debate regarding who was happiest. Solon says “count no man happy until he is dead.” Until then he is just lucky.

The story of Croesus is typical of the Herodutus narrative and perhaps of of history itself: a powerful entity or ruler full of hubris overreaches and meets doom.

# Persian Wars

Cyrus (who defeats Croesus) fathers Darius (480) who in turn fathers Xerxes.

## First persian war (492-490)

Cyrus founds the Achemenid empire (550-330), and sucessfully campaigns the first persian war which gains him thrace and Macedonia.

After the persian victories in the first persian war, there is an interbellum of 10 years during which the persians rule and are a constant threat to the greeks.

## Second persian war (480-479)

The beginning of hostilities is the revolt in Miletus, which the athenians support. If it wasn’t for athenian support to Aristagoras, king of Miletus, the Achemenid empire would have easily crushed that uprise. Instead, the citiy of Sardis ends up burning and Aristagoras has a victory. Because of this Cyrus holds a grudge against athenians and even has a slave to constantly remind him: “Master, remember the Athenians.”

## Battle of Marathon (490 BC)

The persians attack marathon (close to athens) but Herodotus tell us that 192 greeks defeated 6000 persians thanks to flanking hoplite tactics, a deviation from the straightforward attack which was the idea of Miltiades, a great stratego (general) whose helmet still survives ([http://bit.ly/1SD6P6n](http://bit.ly/1SD6P6n)).

One interesting part of marathon as told by Herodotus is the dream of Hippias which was an athenian ex-tyrant now at the service of the persians in the invasion of Marathon. He dreams of having sex with his mother which he misinterprets as a sign that he will go back to athens victorious. Of course this is not so and the battle of marathon is won by the Athenians.

Later Miltiades would be ostracized in 488, as Megakles would too in 487. There is a pattern of great strategoi being later exiled.

After the Marathon victory Pheidippedes runs to Athens, 25 miles, to tell the good news. Dies exhausted thus giving name to the olympic race. Incidentally, the distance of a marathon is 26.2 miles because in 1908 the Royal English family changed it to accommodate the distance between Windsor castle and the final stadium box where the family would be seated.

After marathon, on the Athenian side the main character is Themistocles which is an Odysseus of sorts, a smart trickster, who correctly convinces the Athenians to invest in the first naval fleet. This is called the Naval Policy.

In the mid 480s Darius dies and Xerxes comes in.

## The Thermopylae (480 BC)

Xerxes starts in the Herodotian pattern of power, hubris, greed, and eventual downfall. It is indeed a very dramatic figure almost ridiculously filled with pride and greed. For example it does have the sea whipped with chains after it breaks its bridge at the hellespont.

In august of 480 he attacks the thermopylae and suffers a great defeat at the hands of the brave 300 lead by Leonidas.

After the thermopylae there are more greek victories, particularly at Salamis (480), this time in the sea at the hands of Themistocles and Plateae (479).

The first persian war ends with greek victory, and the end of the persian hegemony.

# The aftermath of the the first persian war

Athens and Sparta rise as first amongst polis. Greece is a political unit (at least for a while): Greek vs Barbarians (those who do not speak greek).

Themistocles advocates fortification against sparta (again, he was on the right track) but this arouses animosity from Sparta and enemies at home seize the opportunity and ostracize him. He takes refuge in Macedonia and eventually ends in Magnesia in the service of the Persian king (after being falsely accused). Later his reputation would be restored but he would die of natural causes in Magnesia.

## The Delian League (477 - 404)

Delios is a small central island in which Ledo was said to have given birth to Apollo and Artemis. The league was a voluntary association of greek states which would contribute annually either ships or money to keep defenses against the persians. It was lead by Athens as first amongst equals (until 454 when Pericles moved the treasury to Athens, signalling quite a change in the nature of the alliance).

## Athenian Empire (454 - 404)

Although not officially disbanded until the end of the peloponesian war in 404, the Delian League transformed quickly into an Athenian control empire of tribute centered in Athens by 454. This strong handed management of the league contributed to the eruption of the peloponesian war.

# Pericles and the Great fifty years (ca. 479-420)

Pericles, the great orator, incorruptible leads Athens trhough a golden age of prosperity and peace, also strengthen defenses against Sparta.
Pericles also establishes the coinage decree and building programs

## Sophocles

Characteristic of the golden years is Sophocles (490-404) who is one of the three ancient greek playwrights whose works still survive (the others being Aesychlus and Euripides). Each year the archons would pick three poets for competition. His work is more powerful and sophisticated than the typical reading of “male v female,” it also accomodates social instruction as shown in Antigone which is not only about the burial of the main character’s brother but about submission to the greater good.

Sophocles Theban plays feature recurrently Oedipus and Antigone.

## Woman’s life

An interesting aspect of the golden years is women’s life and role. Although not citizens (only greek born free males) they did have a big role in religion and economy (Oikos).

Heterai were high end escorts who would have fewer clients at the time (as opposed to pornai) and provided company and intellectual stimulation.

Phryne (really later than pericles but worth the story) was a famous Hetera who inspired many works of art and when accused of a capital crime was acquitted when her defense disrobed her and presented her body as argument.

## Thucydides (460-395)

The other great historian of antiquity, had a great deal of influence from Herodotus, athenian tragedy and and also from the Sophists (professional teachers of rhetoric) in particular Protagoras (“man is the measure of all things”) and the Gorgias. The sophistic influence is felt in the narrative through/preocupation with antithesis: Law (Nomos) vs Nature (Physis) Speech (Logos) vs Action (Ergon) Justice (Dikaion) vs Expediency (Sympheron)

Thucydides writing is monographic, contemporary, not as expansive in understanding of culture and religion and certainly not mythic. Very self-conscious of its own method.

# The Peloponesian War (431-404)

From roughly 479-431 the greek world had more or less enjoyed unity and peace in what is called the 50 great years.

The Megarian Decree, a brutal act of economic warfare, an Athenian imposition to Megara is the flagpost of the beginning of the internal war. The break of 30 years of peace between sparta and athens is cathalyzed by Corinth.

In 430, after the first year of the war, in the corridor created by the fortifications between athens and the pireaus the Plague sprouts. ⅓ of athenians die. Pericles catches it and dies. What follows is a painful period of demagogues and war. In his last speech Pericles had actually an anti-empire tone, suggesting it was best kept in check than further expanded.

After ten years, in 421 the peace of Nicias is signed. It was supposed to be a non-aggression treaty to last 50 years but it’s broken after the first 10.

## Comedy and the Athenian civic life in the lybellum

Thalia, muse of comedy favors Aristophanes and his 11 comedies that survive to our days.

Athenian comedy is worth noting here not only in contrast to tragedy already discussed but as means of social commentary. The protagonist of comedy is a very common man, not the great hero of drama, and its plight deal more with the sympheron (action) than the dikaion (justice). There is also interesting examples of breaking of the fourth wall (Parabasis) and dire commentary as in the megarian hunger which depicts as matter of laughter but also of reflection the dire conditions of Megara where piglet daughters are traded for salt.

## War Resumes

Thucydides actually lists the whole thing as a continuum from 431 to 404. The most telling summary of the peloponnesian war is the Melian Dialogue, in which the arguments of the weak crash against those of the mighty with essentially one conclusion: might is right. The dialog is between Melios and Athens. Athens threatens destruction if tribute is not paid.

“Since you know well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”

We believe of gods and know of man that by a necessary law of their nature they rule whatever they can.

If this was Herodotus it would be the sign of hubris that preceeds the fall. In Thucydides is more of a speech vs action meditation.

# Alcibiades and the fall of Athens

In the symposia (a symposium being a drinking and discussion opportunity between men) none was more popular than Alcibiades (450-404), an olympian winner whose shield was adorned by Eros with thunderbolts. He incites the invasion of sicily as natural expansion of the Athenian might. It’s the beginning of the end.

Nicias, Alcibiades nemesis says to regroup, don’t go to sicily it is all motivated by Alcibiades quest for glory. Alcibiades responds that sicilians are “mostly rubble” and it is the nature of empire to expand.

Before the expedition the gentials of Herms (statues with only head and genitals) are desecrated (presumably by spartans or internal dissidents). this would have been taken by Herodotus as a bad omen. Thucydides has a son who is ordered to stay behind and instead Demostenes is sent over. Also part of the generals is Nicias who had been against the idea.

Demostenes and Nicias are killed and the rest enslaved.

In 411 Aesychlus writes Lysistrata in which the main character tries to end war by denying men of sex.

Alcibiades travels south and talks to the spartans about starting a spartan fleet, seduces wife of a Spartan and flees away...east.

In 410 Thucydides dies. Worst of all Spartans sell to persian gold.

In 408 Alcibiades returns cleared of all charges and given power of commander in chierf. One year later he flees again after public opinion once more turns against him.

In 406 Socrates is the only one to vote against a group trial of enemies.

Finally in 404 Athens is surrounded, besieged, defeated.

## Socrates (470-399)

Quest of truth potentially available to anyone. Socrates thinking lineages is that of Anaxagoras and Protagoras, fierce “humanists” freethinkers.

Socrates didn’t leave us himself any writings. Rather his disciple Plato makes him a central characer in his socratic dialogs (Socrates -> Plato -> Aristotle).

In 399 he is accused of corruption of youth and atheism (not pedophilia but rather the dissemination of unpious ideas).

# End of the Century, Philip II (382-336) and Alexander (356-323)

After the death of the charismatic leaderes of the socratic times, which characterized the King’s peace of 387, the center of Ancient greek history keeps moving north to Macedonia.

The spartans and thebans keep clashing south using the sacred band of lovers (150 couples of man and lover) proving an effective improvement to hoplite ideas, in addition to engineers and war machines.

In 382 Phillip II is born, he is king of macedonia, north of Athens. In 356 introduces the Sarissa a 17 feet spear that makes a big difference in war. In 351 Demostenes rails against phillip in the Phillipic.

In 356 Alexander is born and thanks to his dad desire to assimilate and identify with the Greek culture rather than the persians he is tutored by no less than Aristotle. Through this tutelage Alexander grows with a love of the illyad so him and his friend/companion Hephastion see themselves as Achilles and Patriclos.

Meanwhile in Persia we have Darius III who is depicted in the famous Alexander mosaic. Alexander beats Darius and captures his family but shows mercy. Keeps going to egypt and founds Alexandria (typical of Alexander was to found cities as going along, mixing race and huge tribute economics which would fuel the region for centuries to come).

It is important to note elsewhere in the world the period we have seen in this course is also important, and some have referred to it as the Axial age, with Confucius 551-479 in China and Siddartha 550-480 in India.

In 323 Alexander dies and the Hellenistic age begins.

“We are all Greeks.” -- Percy Bysshe Shelley, Hellas 1821
