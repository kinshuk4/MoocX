You can think of a DataFrame as a group of Series that share an index.
This makes it easy to select specific columns that you want from the
DataFrame.

Also a couple pointers:
1) Selecting a single column from the DataFrame will return a Series
2) Selecting multiple columns from the DataFrame will return a DataFrame

Row selection can be done through multiple ways.

Some of the basic and common methods are:
   1) Slicing
   2) An individual index (through the functions iloc or loc)
   3) Boolean indexing

You can also combine multiple selection requirements through boolean
operators like & (and) or | (or)

# Change False to True to see boolean indexing in action
if True:
    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}

    print football.iloc[[0]]
    print ""
    print football.loc[[0]]
    print ""
    print football[3:5]
    print ""
    print football[football.wins > 10]
    print ""
    print football[(football.wins > 10) & (football.team == "Packers")]
