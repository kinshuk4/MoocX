**Module 1 Assignment 2**

  Following are the relevant figures extracted from the balance sheet and income statement of two companies, a consumer electronics manufacturer and a large retailer.

# 2. Operational Concepts

## 2.1 Compute the asset turnover for each company.

```{r AT, echo = FALSE}
at <- suppressWarnings(as.list(paste0(round(tbl1[1, ]/tbl1[3, ] * 100, 2), '%')))
at %<>% data.frame %>% tbl_df
names(at) <- names(tbl2)
at %<>% mutate(Category = 'Asset Turnover')
at <- rbind(tbl2[c(1, 3), ], at)

at %>% kable(Caption = 'Table 2.1 : Comparison of Asset-Turnover of two companies')
```

*Table 2.1 : Comparison of Asset-Turnover of two companies.*

**What is 'Asset Turnover Ratio'?**

  Asset turnover ratio is the ratio of the value of a company’s sales or revenues generated relative to the value of its assets. The Asset Turnover ratio can often be used as an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is deploying its assets in generating revenue.

  $Asset Turnover = Sales or Revenues / Total Assets$

  Generally speaking, the higher the asset turnover ratio, the better the company is performing, since higher ratios imply that the company is generating more revenue per dollar of assets. Yet, this ratio can vary widely from one industry to the next. As such, considering the asset turnover ratios of an energy company and a telecommunications company will not make for an accurate comparison. Comparisons are only meaningful when they are made for different companies within the same sector.

## 2.2 Compute the operating margin for each company.

```{r OM, echo = FALSE}
om <- suppressWarnings(as.list(paste0(round(tbl1[2, ]/tbl1[1, ] * 100, 2), '%')))
om %<>% data.frame %>% tbl_df
names(om) <- names(tbl2)
om %<>% mutate(Category = 'Operating Margin')
om <- rbind(tbl2[c(2, 1), ], om)

om %>% kable(Caption = 'Table 2.4 : ')
```

*Table 2.2 : Comparison of Operating-Margin of two companies.*

**What is an 'Operating Margin'?**

  Operating margin is a margin ratio used to measure a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency.

  Operating margin is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages, raw materials, etc. It can be calculated by dividing a company’s operating income (also known as *operating profit*) during a given period by its net sales during the same period. *Operating income* here refers to the profit that a company retains after removing operating expenses (such as cost of goods sold and wages) and depreciation. *Net sales* here refers to the total value of sales minus the value of returned goods, allowances for damaged and missing goods, and discount sales.

  Operating margin is expressed as a percentage, and the formula for calculating operating margin can be represented in the following way:

  $Operating Margin = Operating Income / Net Sales$

  Operating margin is also often known as *operating profit margin*, *operating income margin*, *return on sales* or as *net profit margin*. However, *net profit margin* may be misleading in this case because it is more frequently used to refer to another ratio, net margin.

## 2.3 Compute the return on equity for each company.

```{r ROE, echo = FALSE}
roe <- suppressWarnings(as.list(paste0(round(tbl1[2, ]/tbl1[4, ] * 100, 2), '%')))
roe %<>% data.frame %>% tbl_df
names(roe) <- names(tbl2)
roe %<>% mutate(Category = 'Return of Equity')
roe <- rbind(tbl2[c(2, 4), ], roe)

roe %>% kable(Caption = 'Table 2.3 : Comparison of Return-On-Equity of two companies')
```

*Table 2.3 : Comparison of Return-On-Equity of two companies.*

**What is 'Return On Equity - ROE'?**

  Return on equity (ROE) is the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

  ROE is expressed as a percentage and calculated as:

  $Return on Equity = Net Income/Shareholder's Equity$

  Net income is for the full fiscal year (before dividends paid to common stock holders but after dividends to preferred stock.) Shareholder's equity does not include preferred shares.

  Also known as *return on net worth* (RONW).

## 2.4 What does your analysis suggest about the differences in operations performance of the two companies?

```{r SM, echo = FALSE}
sm <- suppressWarnings(rbind_all(list(tail(at, 1), tail(om, 1), tail(roe, 1))))
sm %>% kable(Caption = 'Table 2.4 : Operations Performance')
```

*Table 2.4 : Comparison of Operations Performance of two companies.*

  We can compare the companies above to know that :-

**Case Study :**

  I used to work as a customer service operator in Ladbrokes Far East Asian department (Scicom MSC Bhd) and now I've affiliate business partnership with Ladbrokes and some other companies.  From my personal view, I try to separate the digital business and brick-and-mortar retailing outlet of Ladbokes as example. I assume that Consumer Electronic is digital business operates around the World while Large Retailer is the outlets which operates within Europe.

1) Asset Turnover >>> 
   - The asset of digital subsidiary company or department is smaller since there has just only server and some IT related staffs as well as a centralized customer support department needed. I try to assume that only 300 staffs for digital business.
   - The asset of retailer outlet or department is larger since every single brick-and-mortar outlet required staffs, property and also fixed expenses. The number of staff for retailer is extremely higher which might probably more than 10,000 staffs.

2) Operating margin >>>
   - The net profit generates by digital department is higher due to low flexible cost for wages, rentals etc.

3) Return on Equity >>>
   - The return of investment on digital business is higher than retailer business. Which means every single unit of shares that investors invest on Ladbrokes via stock market has generate higher return/dividend from the portion of digital business.

# 3. Conclusion

  There has only few importance figures took into counting in this assignment. If both balance sheet and income statement of a company is not faud, the operational perforamce might reflect the healthiness of a company. We/Investors can easily know the potential of growth/profitable, if the company is overvalued or undervalued and if it is worth or valued to invest their fund.
  
  There are a lot of figure that has not been states while it can be analysed and know the [*intrinsic value*](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) which is always quote and measure by [Warren Buffet](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/warren-buffett-intrinsic-value-two-problems/).

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  Same as pevious assignment --- [Operations Management : Module 1 Assignment 1](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/operational-management-module1-assignment1), I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the management course via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I like reading the legend of business tycoons (for example: Konosuke Matsushita, Peter Drucker, Bill Gates, Warrent Buffet, George Soros, Jim Rogers, Lee Kah Sheng, Henry Fok Ying Tung, Peter Lynch, Lim Goh Tong etc) to know how was their mindset and business strategy since I was a computer science student in Tunku Abdul Rahman College. I used to read the legend of **Warren Buffet** and then started my journey in financial market before join sportsbook industry.
