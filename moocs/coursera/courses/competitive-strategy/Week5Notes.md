# Stages of R & D

#### Basic Research
* Development of scientific knowledge: the outcomes are difficult to protect. 
* Knowledge spillovers, or contacts. Prisoner's dilema, done in universities and labs.
* Can be protected by patents or copyright, if two firms develop similar products, whoever comes first wins. often leeds to patent races.

#### Applied Research
* Application of scientific knowledge to the solution of a specific problem

#### Product Development
* Identification of relevant consumers, tailor product to needs of the consumers

# Types of Innovations
Two types:

#### Product Innovation
* Improvement of an existing product
* Increase in willingness to pay of existing/potential buyers
* Example: New mixture of rubber that keeps the car stable at high speeds

#### Process Innovation
* Novel way of producting an existing product
* Leads to reduction of production costs

#### Drastic vs Incremental Innovation
##### Drastic Innovation
* The innovator can behave as a monopolist in the market (despite substitute products)
* Example: Development of electric car

##### Incremental Innovation
* The innovator can increase pr ofits but its strategy is still restricted by other non-innovating firms
* Example: Improvement of battery unit that increases range or electric car

# Incentives to Innovate

## Competitive Market
#### Example
##### Setup
* 100 consumers interested in motorbikes
  * 60 consumers would pay maximum 500 Euros
  * 40 consumers would pay maximum 400 Euros
* With current tecnology: total production costs of 300 Euros

* **New process innovation:** total production costs of 200 Euros

* Whoever spends most on the innovation gets the innovation
  * By being granted a patent or 
  * Being fist in the market

* Assume 10 companies producing and selling motorbikes in the competitive market
* Prior to innovation, all have the same production technology

##### Without Innovation
* Total production costs of 300 Euros
* Each company sets price equal to costs
* Each company makes profits of zero

##### With Innovation
* Total production costs of
  * 200 Euros for company that gets innovation
  * 300 Euros for all others
* Company with innovation can set a price of 299 Euros
* All consumers buy from this company
* The overall profits of the company that innovates are 100*(299-200) = 100*99 = 9900
* All other companies make zero profits

##### Value of Innovation
Value of innovation to the focul company
* Profits with innovation: 9900
* Profits withot innovation: 0
* 9900 is the value of innovation, how much each firm will be willing to pay to get patent that reduces the production costs.


## Monopolist
* Same Set Up as before.
* Monopolist
* 1 company producing and selling motorbikes
* No threat of entry of competitors

##### Without Innovation
* Production costs of 300 Euros
* **Monopolist sets price of 500 Euros**
  * 60 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 60(500-300) = 60*200 = 12,000 <- best strategy here
* Monopolist sets price of 400 Euros
  * 100 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 100(400-300) = 100*100 = 10,000

##### With Innovation
* Production costs of 200 Euros
* Monopolist sets price of 500 Euros
  * 60 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 60(500-200) = 60*300=18,000
* Monopolist sets price of 400 Euros
  * 100 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 100(400-200) = 100*200 = 20,000 <- best strategy here

##### Value of Innovation
* Value of innovation to the monopolist
  * Profits with innovation: 20,000
  * Profits without innovation: 12,000
* Value = 20,000 - 12,000 = 8,000

#### Comparison
Value of innovation
* Competitive Market: 9,900 Euros
* Monopolist: 8,000 Euros
* Replacement effect: For a given market structure, a monopolist has less incentive to innovate because of the higher level of pre-innovation profits.

## Monopolist with Threat of Entry
* Same set up as before
* Monopolist
  * 1 company producing and selling motorbikes
* Potential entrant
  * Potential entrant interested in innovation

##### With Innovation
* Entrant stays out of the market
* Production costs of 200 Euros for monopolist
* Monopolist sets price of 500 Euros
  * 60 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are (500-200) Euros * 60 = 18,000 Euros
* Monopolist sets price of 400 Euros
  * 100 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are (400-200) Euros * 10 = 20,000 Euros

##### Without Innovation
* Entrants enters the market
* Monopolist and entrant agree on price of 400 Euros
* Market is shared equally (50 consumers each)
* Production costs of
  * 300 Euros for monopolist
  * 200 Euros for entrant
* Profits for monopolist are 50(400 - 300) = 5,000
* Profits for entrant are 50(400 - 200) = 10,000

##### Value of Innovation
Value of innovation to the monopolist
* Profits of innovation: 20,000
* Profits without innovation: 5,000
  -> 15,000
  Value of innovation to the entrant
* Profits of innovation: 10,000
* Profits without innovation; 0
  -> 10,000 

#### Comparison
* Value of innovation
  * Competitive Market: 9,900 Euros
  * Monopolist: 8,000 Euros
  * Monopolist with threat of entry: 15,000 Euros
  * Entrant: 10,000 Euros
* Efficiency effect: Under the threat of entry, a monopolist has higher incentives to innovate than a potential entrant into a market.

#### Trade-Off
* Replacement effect: Less innovation by monopolist
* Efficiency Effect: More innovation by monopolist
  The higher the probability of entry, the more the efficiency effect will take place.

# Innovation Under Competition
### Trade-Off
Research & Development
* Chance of innovation with promising returns
* Risk of losing R & D investments
  * If no success at all
  * If other company is faster

### Set-Up
* Pharmaceutical companies (A and B)
* Have to decide whether to engage in R&D for a new drug against asthma
* Fixed costs for R&D activity of 10 mn pounds
* With likelihood **p** they come up with a marketable innovation
* Profits from innovation
  * 24 mn pounds if alone on the market
  * 10 mn pounds if with a competitor on the market

### Payoffs for Comapny A
* Company A engages in R&D, company B does not: p*24 + (1-p)*0 - 10 = 24p - 10

* Both companies engage in R&D: p(1-p)*24 + p*p*10 + (1-p)*0 - 10
* Company A does not engage in R&D: profits = 0

### Payoff Matrix
Firm A (left) vs Firm B (top)

#### p not known

|        | No R&D   | R&D                               |
| ------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| No R&D | 0/0      | 0/24p-10                          |
| R&D    | 24p-10/0 | p(1-p)*24 + p*p*10 + (1-p)*0 - 10 |


#### p = 0.25

|        | No R&D | R&D           |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| No R&D | 0/0    | 0/-4          |
| R&D    | -4/0   | -4.875/-4.875 |


#### p = 0.5

|        | No R&D | R&D       |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| No R&D | 0/0    | 0/2       |
| R&D    | 2/0    | -1.5/-1.5 |

#### p = 0.75

|        | No R&D | R&D         |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| No R&D | 0/0    | 0/8         |
| R&D    | 8/0    | 0.125/0.125 |


### Comparison of Success Rates
* Low success rate -> no R&D at all
* Medium success rate -> R&D by one firm and pre-emption
* High success rate -> R&D by both firms

# Sleeping Patents
### Phenomenon
* Companies often apply for relatively minor patents
* They have no intention of ever comercialising these
  -> Why?

### Idea
Patenting innovations that are close to own main product
* Preventing competitors from inventing a close rival to own product
* Maintain monopoly position

### Example
* Xerox was using sleeping patents to secure monopoly position in professional copier market
* Reasoning: Practice was hindering technological progress
